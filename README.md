# EDUTV(ECCV 2022, Oral presentation)
**This is official repository of EDUTV(Event-guied Deblurring of Unknown Exposure Time Videos)**

## Qualitative Videos on real-world and synthetic unknown exposure time videos

## Color-DVS dataset for event-guided motion deblurring
#### The first public event-based deblurring dataset. Our dataset contain diverse scene including real-world event using color-DAVIS camera.
You can download the raw-data(collected frame and events) from this google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16qlLDOm5Q6fqpDYxNYMtm7reGfzaOyra/view?usp=sharing)
